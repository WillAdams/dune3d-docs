Entities
========

Entities are items such as lines, circles or arcs drawn by the user or 
automatically generated by groups.

This list only includes entities that can be drawn by the user.

Entities can either be in a workplane, i.e. in 2D space or in 3D space.
Entities in a workplane can only be created if the current group has an 
active workplane. 

All entities can either be construction or normal entities. 
Construction entities are ignored when finding closed paths for 
creating the solid model. Construction entities are only visible if 
they're in the currently active group.

2D Line
-------

A line in a workplane defined by its start and end point. It thus adds 
4 degrees of freedom.

:In Workplane: yes
:Tool: Draw contour, Draw line in workplane

2D Arc
-------

An arc in a workplane defined by its start, end and center points. For 
each arc, there's an implicit constraint that constrains the center 
point to have the same distance from both ends. It adds 5 degrees of 
freedom.

An arc with coincident start and end point is a full circle.

:In Workplane: yes
:Tool: Draw contour, Draw arc in workplane

2D Circle
---------

A circle in a workplane defined by its center point and radius. It adds 
three degrees of freedom.

:In Workplane: yes
:Tool: Draw circle in workplane


3D Line
-------

A line in 3D space defined by its start and end point. It thus adds 
6 degrees of freedom.

:In Workplane: no
:Tool: Draw line in 3D

Workplane
---------

A workplane defines a local 2D coordinate system using an origin 
point and a rotation in 3D space. It adds 6 degrees of freedom: 3 
translational and 3 rotational.

Use the "Constrain workplane normal", "Constrain same orientation" or 
"Lock rotation"
tools to constrain the rotational degrees of freedom.

A workplane's size and name can be changed in the "Selection" tab after 
selecting it.

:In Workplane: no
:Tool: Draw workplane

STEP model
----------

Geometry imported from a STEP file. :doc:`step-import` for more 
details.

:In Workplane: no
:Tool: Import STEP

2D Point
--------

A point in a workplane defined by its location. It thus adds 
2 degrees of freedom.

:In Workplane: yes
:Tool: Draw point in workplane
